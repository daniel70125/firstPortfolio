        <h2>Presidency</h2>
        <h3>Written By:Ruth</h3>
        <p>As we are approaching the end of this year we find ourselves as fellow citizens recognizing services for the 41st President 
        George B.W. Bush. When we look at presidents who served in the past, each one leaves behind a legacy. Maybe we can think of a 
        theme song to describe the term of service our leaders of the country remind us of. When you think of Mr. George H. W. Bush
        you think of his loyalty to his country and family. When you think of President Barack Obama you think of his swag yet professional,
        smart leadership and the example he and his family set for all not just African Americans , but for ALL Americans. When I think of 
        the current president I pray for the best from him, but his current leadership makes me think of his reality show, “The Apprentice”
        and grow in our reality as citizens we see his staff leaving the White House like a revolving door not waiting for him to ask them 
        to resign, but they actually quit. This reminds me of the following theme song: <br><br>
        
        Because working here is the pits and i’m taking ALL this <br>
    	I QUIT I QUIT I QUIT I QUIT <br><br>
    	And i’m tired of arrogant pricks with ALL their game and tricks <br>
        I QUIT I QUIT I QUIT I QUIT<br><br>
        And i hate backstabbing chicks with ALL their gossip and cliques
    	I QUIT I QUIT I QUIT I QUIT<br><br>
    	
    	I am CHALLENGING any and all entertainers from rap, R&B, country, rock and roll, etc. to come up with a beat and melody for my song
    	so we all can sing along to the theme for the current president. Now trump that. The above song has more powerful lyrics and is a 
    	copy written. Who will accept the challenge?
